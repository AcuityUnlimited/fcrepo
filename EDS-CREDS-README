This branch contains an experimental version of Fedora that supports
passing Basic Authentication credentials for "E" datastreams, through
the use of a global configuration file, server/config/eds-creds.conf

To build it:
------------
1) Make sure you have a recent subversion command line client.
   If you don't, you can get one for your OS at:
   http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
2) Make sure you have a recent version of maven installed.
   If you don't, you can download it from:
   http://maven.apache.org/download.html
3) Check out the branch from subversion, via:
     svn co https://fedora-commons.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fedora-commons/fedora/branches/fcrepo-748
4) Build the installer using maven, via:
     cd fcrepo-748
     mvn install -P fedora-installer
     (if you haven't yet built a recent version of Fedora, this will take a while)

To install it:
--------------
Do a normal installation[1], but instead of running the installer downloaded from
sourceforge, use fcrepo-installer/target/fcrepo-installer-3.5-SNAPSHOT.jar

To test it:
-----------
Before starting Fedora, copy the eds-creds.conf file (from this directory) into 
the $FEDORA_HOME/server/conf/ directory.

Start Fedora via $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh

Visit http://localhost:8080/fedora/admin in your browser, and ingest the
test_eds-creds.xml file.  This Fedora object already contains an "E" datastream
with ID "DS" that points to a Basic Authentication protected URL on the web.
The eds-creds.conf file you copied already contains the proper credentials for
accessing this URL.

Visit http://localhost:8080/fedora/objects/test:eds-creds/datastreams/DS/content
in your browser. If it worked properly, you should see that the body of the page
says "Basic Authentication test passed successfully".

To configure it for your own use:
---------------------------------
Read the comments in the $FEDORA_HOME/server/conf/eds-creds.conf file to
understand how the configuration works.

When you make your own changes to this file, Fedora (tomcat) must be restarted.
